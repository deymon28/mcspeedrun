progression:
  # Stage 1: Basic setup
  1_GETTING_STARTED:
    world: "NORMAL" # Tasks are displayed when the player is in this world.

  # Stage 3: Preparing for the Nether
  #  3_NETHER_PREP:
  #    world: "NORMAL"
  #    tasks:
  #      # Players need to find a village to get beds, or for other reasons.
  #      # This is a special task type that completes when the structure is found (via Bell or proximity).
  #      STRUCTURE_VILLAGE: { display-name: "Find a Village" }
  #      # This task completes when a Nether portal is successfully lit in the Overworld.

#      # Consider adding a specific task for killing the dragon here if you want it tracked as a task.
#      # For now, it's just the end condition.

# Optional cosmetic rewards for completing tasks or stages.
# ----------------------------------------------------------------
rewards:
  enabled: true # Set to true to enable rewards
  # Command to run from the console when a single task is completed.
  # Use @p (closest player) or @a (all players) instead of %player% for console commands if specific player context isn't passed.
  on-task-complete:
    - "particle minecraft:totem_of_undying %player% ~ ~1 ~ 1 1 1 0.1 50 normal"    # Target closest player
    - "playsound minecraft:entity.player.levelup master %player% ~ ~ ~ 1 1.5" # Target closest player
  # Command to run when all tasks in a stage are completed.
  # These are usually for all players, so @a is appropriate.
  on-stage-complete:
    - "tellraw @a [{\"text\":\"Stage Complete!\",\"color\":\"gold\",\"bold\":true}]"
    - "particle minecraft:firework @a ~ ~1 ~ 1 1 1 0.1 100 normal"
